## snakemake

For convenience, we provide a snakemake script that recreates the major results of the analysis reported in the main manuscript.
See `Sustainable data analysis with Snakemake <https://f1000research.com/articles/10-33>`_ for an introduction 
and the `Snakemake documentation <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for details.

See this [README](Snakemake/README.md) file for instructions on how to run the analysis.
